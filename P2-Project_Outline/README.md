## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A flashcard generator that extracts words from a text to create a deck. The user uploads a text, or selects one from an API. The user selects the frequency range of the words to populate the fronts of the cards (i.e., given a user-chosen range of x% to y%, each word extracted will have occured in the text x% to y% of the total word count). For each word within the chosen frequency range, the flashcard generator will place a word and the sentence in which it was found on the front of a card, and an API-extracted definition of the word on the back of that card.

This software will facilitate learning not only by virtue of the application, itself, but also by "priming" the user to read the selected text, so that when the user comes upon a word they have studied on a flashcard, they will have the opportunity to recall the word within the rich context that the text provides--a context uninterrupted by looking up the word in a dictionary.
